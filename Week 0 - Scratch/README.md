# JCM2020

Scratch project created for Week 0 of CS50.
Basic functionality basketball game.

The conceit is that you're a virtuoso basketball player so you never miss a shot 
(a.k.a. I found it too hard to programme physics, when shot the ball will glide directly to the target.) 
So the challenge is that as the score increases, so too does the speed of the ball.

Features include;
Different sprites;
Score goes up, timer goes down;
Background music;
Goal cheers;
Sprite limited to movement on the court, while ball can bounce freely;
And so on

Things to improve:
Aim mechanism
Speed increase for ball
Make so a score is only registered after hitting target from a shot,
  As opposed to just when it is bouncing free
  This occurs more frequently as the ball speeds up
